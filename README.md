# WETH

**Wrapped ETH is, like the name says, Ether, but wrapped.** 

**Well, it's not literally wrapped in something, but you can imagine that if certain transactions want to be made with an ETH peg, you have to wrap it. Why? Because ETH is not an ERC20 and since ERC20 is the industry standard, you wrap ETH into an ERC20. Now it acts as an ERC20 and you can successfully do what you initially wanted to. Unless there's a problem with the DAPP you're interacting with ðŸ˜¨**

```
Deposit
```
*Deposit event acts like a deposit state variable. But why is it an event then? Because events require less gas than storage variables. Events don't actually get stored in storage like storage variables or else they wouldn't be cheaper. They aren't accessible to the smart contract, but they're basically mapped to the cotract address and they're stored in LOGS. Now, if you already know what your storage variable is going to do, I highly advise you to check if you have the option to use an event in yor smart contract. Since events are stored in LOGS, they can really only the one thing you tell them. That's why you ```emit``` them.*

```
Withdraw
```
*Same as deposit, except you're doing the oppsoite, which is withdrawing.*

```
deposit()
```
*Function that allows users to deposit their ETH and mint WETH in return.*

```
withdraw()
```
*Function that allows users to withdraw their ETH, but burns their WETH.*

```
fallback()
```
*Fallback is called when users directly send ETH to the smart contract. Since fallback includes ```deposit()```, users have the option to indirectly deposit their ETH, by sending ETH to the smart contract directly.*
